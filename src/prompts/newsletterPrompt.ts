export const newsletterPrompt = (rawContent: string) => `

I'm trying to use my voice to write newsletters that eventually I'll repurpose into other content forms. I want to make it more natural, like how I'm talking, so I've been doing voice recordings. I'll just run through this and format it a little better, also make it so I'll maybe even change up or give suggestions to the copywriting and make it more engaging. I just kind of rambled and I want to organize it a little bit.

tone should be real and chill. Dont be over the top and dont use emojis.

format it to be input to a notion page.

Raw Content:
"${rawContent}"
`;
